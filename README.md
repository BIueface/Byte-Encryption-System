# VHDL Encryption-Decryption System üîê

## Overview

This project is a laboratory exercise for the ECE 410 course, focusing on combinational logic design using VHDL. The goal is to create an encryption-decryption system that processes an 8-bit message, ensuring that the message corresponds to a capital letter before applying encryption and decryption techniques.

## Features ‚ú®

- **ASCII Verification**: Ensures the input is an uppercase letter (A-Z).
- **8-bit Barrel Shifters**: Shifts the message based on a 4-bit key that indicates direction and magnitude for added security against man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **XOR Encryption/Decryption**: Encrypts and decrypts the message using an 8-bit key.
- **Lowercase Conversion**: Converts the final message from uppercase to lowercase.

## System Design üõ†Ô∏è

### ASCII Verification

The first step in the process checks whether the 8-bit input corresponds to an ASCII value representing a capital letter (A-Z). If the input does not meet this criterion, all output bits are 0.

### Barrel Shifter

The system includes an 8-bit barrel shifter that operates based on a 4-bit key:
- The key determines the direction (left or right) and the number of positions to shift the message.

### XOR Encryption/Decryption

An 8-bit XOR block performs the encryption and decryption:
- The system takes an 8-bit key and applies the XOR operation with the shifted message.

### Final Conversion

After the XOR operation, the resulting 8-bit message is converted from its uppercase representation to its lowercase form, revealing the final output.

## Usage üìö

1. **Compile the VHDL code**: Use a VHDL simulator to compile the provided files.
2. **Run provided testbench files**: Observe the output message after processing each input.

## Requirements ‚úÖ

- VHDL simulator (e.g., ModelSim, Vivado)
- Basic understanding of VHDL and combinational logic design
- ECE 410 course materials for context and reference
